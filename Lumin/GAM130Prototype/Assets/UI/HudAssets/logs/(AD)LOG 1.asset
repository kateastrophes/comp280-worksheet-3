  text: "I don\u2019t know what kind of crazy technology they're using to keep that
    thing running but it\u2019s causing our power output to skyrocket- that bulb in
    the plant lab that\u2019s always starts flickering after it\u2019s been on for
    a few hours? It\u2019s now the brightest bulb in the room. I think it\u2019s making
    the incubator lights brighter too, the specimens appear to be growing  at a rapid
    pace; I\u2019m worried we\u2019re going to run out of tanks to keep them in."
