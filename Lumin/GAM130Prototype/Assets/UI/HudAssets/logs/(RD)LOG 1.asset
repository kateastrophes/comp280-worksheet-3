  text: "This is one of the most boring jobs yet, we just stand in this room and stop
    people from coming in, but nobody comes near us because they\u2019re actually
    doing their jobs! All we do is stand around, I don\u2019t know why they hired
    us to come out here and guard a room, it\u2019d be cheaper to get some of their
    own guys in to do this."
