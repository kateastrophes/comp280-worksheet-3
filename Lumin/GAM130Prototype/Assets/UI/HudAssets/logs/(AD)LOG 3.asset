  text: "One of the interns went into the modified rafflesia greenhouse today without
    a mask on; she\u2019s lucky one of the security guys noticed and managed to raise
    the alarm- she was out for a few minutes and got one hell of a reprimanding but
    there\u2019s no lasting damage. I keep telling HR they should put signs up, but
    they won\u2019t listen to me, it\u2019s going to take someone dying before they
    actually do anything."
