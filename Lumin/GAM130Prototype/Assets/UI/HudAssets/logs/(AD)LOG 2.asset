  text: "More problems for Dome 2; one of the pipes burst, flooding half the dome.The
    head of research is pissed, they lost lost a lot of samples- half of the greenhouses
    were destroyed and the ones that weren't, the samples became waterlogged- we might
    end up having to throw them all out! Two months of research and careful experimentation
    wasted because of one burst pipe, sometimes I wish I\u2019d taken a position in
    the arachnid lab."
